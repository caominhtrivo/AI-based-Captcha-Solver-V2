AI-based Captcha Solver V2
**Overview**
This project presents a machine learning solution to solve Google reCAPTCHA v2 challenges. It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using transfer learning with the InceptionV3 architecture, a powerful pre-trained model. The model is trained to classify images belonging to various categories commonly found in CAPTCHA tasks.

**Key Features**
Transfer Learning: Utilizes the InceptionV3 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, as a feature extractor.

Data Augmentation: Employs Keras' ImageDataGenerator to artificially expand the training dataset and improve model robustness.

Custom Classifier: Adds custom dense and dropout layers on top of the pre-trained model to fine-tune it for the CAPTCHA image classification task.

Optimizer: Uses the Adam optimizer with a low learning rate for stable training.

Performance Evaluation: Visualizes the model's performance using a confusion matrix to highlight correct and incorrect predictions.

**Project Structure**
The dataset should be organized in a specific directory structure for the flow_from_directory function to work correctly.

**Dependencies**
This project requires the following libraries. You can install them using pip:

pip install tensorflow
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
Usage
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
cd your-repository-name
Place the dataset: Ensure your CAPTCHA image data is placed in the data/ directory with the structure mentioned above.

Run the notebook: Open the google-recapcha-ml-solver.ipynb notebook in a Jupyter environment and run all cells. The notebook will automatically handle data loading, model training, and evaluation.

Results
The notebook will print the number of trainable and non-trainable parameters, show the training accuracy and loss history, and finally display a confusion matrix. The confusion matrix will provide a detailed breakdown of the model's performance on the test set, showing which classes are being predicted correctly and where misclassifications are occurring.
